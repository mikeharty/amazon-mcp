## Start and recover
Call amazon_capabilities to obtain accountRef, readTools and writeTools. Call amazon_diagnostics when access is unavailable or jobs appear stuck. Diagnostics checks local configuration and journal metadata only; worker liveness is not proof of Amazon authentication. Its recovery steps are guidance, not actions already performed.

## Durable operations
Browser tools return {status: "pending", operationId}. Poll operations_get with that ID about once per second. queued, working and dispatching are in-progress journal states. Retain the handle on timeout or disconnect; the operation may still finish. operations_list returns recent metadata with optional accountRef, kind, mode and status filters. Pass nextCursor back with the same filters; changing limit is allowed. Ordering uses creation time and ID, and status filters reflect current state. Fetch a selected result with operations_get. Operation history never means purchase history.

Cancel only queued work using operations_cancel with the observed revision. This cannot cancel an Amazon order or stop an action already dispatched. Never submit a fresh write after outcome_unknown. Quarantine requires operator reconciliation from observed state, not a retry or a missing order record.

## Research and account reads
Use products_search, then products_get for the exact ASIN, and offers_list/products_compare for observed offers. Check currency, seller, condition, delivery context and missing fields before comparing. Data is an observation, not a guaranteed current price.

Use orders_list with page, inspect pagination, then orders_get and shipments_get with the observed orderId. A shipment read visits at most five displayed tracking pages. Milestone state distinguishes complete, incomplete and unknown; future steps are not completed delivery events. Invoice labels establish availability only, not downloaded documents. subscriptions_list inventories visible subscriptions but cannot change them.

## Product research, images and price alerts
products_research reads two to five distinct ASINs and ranks observed item price, displayed rating and requested feature phrases using explicit weights. Show source excerpts, timestamps, unknowns, budget eligibility and limitations. Its score is not verified compatibility, quality, seller eligibility or delivered cost. The assistant should explain tradeoffs using the returned evidence. product_image_get accepts a completed products_get/product_media_list operation, or a products_research operation plus asin, and returns an MCP image with a source URL. Client display support varies.

price_alert_create uses USD targetMinorUnits and one stable idempotencyKey. The default first valid observation alerts if already at/below target; subsequent alerts require a new downward crossing. Use watches_list/pause/delete to manage it and events_list for delivery. No actual alert should be created without the user's product, price and intent. Read-only Amazon mode still permits local alerts.

orders_search filters observed order titles/ASINs/IDs and dates across bounded pages. Show scannedPages, stopReason, unknownDatesExcluded and nextPage. It does not change Amazon's current history window or establish exhaustive history. Summary totals are whole-order displayed amounts, not matched-item spend or net refunds. orders_export returns CSV/JSON text plus coverage; save private exports only at the user's requested destination.

For session recovery, stop local:start and run pnpm run local:start --login. For manually launched services, stop the old worker first. No live profile lock is stolen. AMAZON_READ_ONLY defaults true and blocks Amazon writes in both gateway and worker.

## Coverage and authentication
Check status, coverage.missing and observation.observedAt. required: entries mean required evidence was not established; do not treat an unrecognized empty extraction as an empty account. source_completeness does not establish exhaustive history. cart_mutation_evidence permits reading saved items but is not sufficient evidence for editing them. On requires_user_action, show the handoff. The user completes MFA/CAPTCHA in the dedicated browser; do not collect passwords, OTPs or cookies through MCP.

## Changes and notifications
Cart edits require the exact current revision and line/offer identity. Preserve one idempotency key for one logical request. Checkout snapshots are not purchase authorization. Checkout submission, cancellation, returns and subscription commits are not exposed. Drafts are never published automatically.

Watches require explicit user intent and use the durable inbox: events_list and amazon://events. Follow the returned cursor to page through events. Acknowledge only after presenting them. Monitoring requires the Mac and worker to be awake; MCP does not wake a closed client. Paid Keepa and retained observation history remain opt-in.
